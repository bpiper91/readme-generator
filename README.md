# Professional README Generator

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

## Description

The link above outlines the various elements that should go into a professional-looking README file. To help developers save time, this command-line application takes some user input and quickly generates a professional README.md file for their GitHub repo.

## Installation and Usage

Utilizing this app is simple with Node.js:

1. From the command line, clone the repo to your local machine using `git clone git@github.com:bpiper91/readme-generator.git`.

2. Navigate into the root directory and run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.

3. Once the installation has finished, run `node index` to initialize the application.

4. Follow the prompts to provide your GitHub username, email address, project title, project description, etc., and click enter after each response. (For the license question, use the Up and Down arrow keys to navigate through the list and click enter. Use the `No License` option at the top of the list if you want to skip that section in the README.)

5. Once you have answered all of the questions, you should get a message that a README.md file has been created successfully. You can find it by running `cd output` to access the output directory and then opening `README.md` in your preferred code editor.

[You can watch a quick walkthrough of the app here](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/zSrpEq7cvxkc34a1lCrM). The README file generated in the video is saved in the repo as [sample/README.md](./sample/README.md).
